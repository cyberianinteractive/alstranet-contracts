## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive technical specifications for the Police & Thief Web3 Application to be developed on the AlstraNet blockchain platform. The application will serve as a blockchain interface for the Police & Thief game ecosystem, enabling players to manage digital assets, participate in governance, engage in economic activities, and extend their gameplay experience.

The web3 application will leverage AlstraNet's blockchain technology to provide true ownership of in-game assets as NFTs, participation in decentralized governance through the DAO, and engagement with DeFi features for economic gameplay. The application will support three distinct factions—Law Enforcement, Criminal Syndicates, and Vigilantes—each with specialized features and interfaces.

This technical specification outlines system architecture, feature requirements, security considerations, user experience design, and implementation guidelines required for successful development. It serves as the primary reference document for all stakeholders involved in the development process.

## Introduction & Background

### Project Overview

The Police & Thief Web3 Application is a blockchain-integrated platform designed to enhance the core game experience by providing players with tools to manage their digital assets, participate in governance, and engage in economic activities within the game's ecosystem. Built on the AlstraNet platform, this application will bridge traditional gaming with blockchain technology, creating a seamless connection between in-game actions and on-chain activities.

The application aims to:

- Provide secure wallet management for game-related Alstra tokens
- Create a marketplace for trading NFT assets including properties, vehicles, and equipment
- Enable participation in DAO governance for game economic decisions
- Facilitate territory control through token staking mechanics
- Offer DeFi functionality integrated with game economics
- Support faction-specific features for Law Enforcement, Criminal Syndicates, and Vigilantes

### Game World Context

Police & Thief is set in Lagos, Nigeria, featuring a complex urban environment where law enforcement agencies, criminal syndicates, and vigilante groups compete for influence, resources, and territorial control. The game incorporates:

- **Faction-Based Gameplay**: Players align with law enforcement agencies, criminal organizations, or vigilante groups, each with unique objectives and abilities.
- **Territorial Control**: Different zones of Lagos can be influenced or controlled by factions through staking and activities.
- **Economic Systems**: In-game economy featuring legal and black market transactions, property ownership, and business operations.
- **Dynamic Events**: Crime waves, police crackdowns, gang wars, and other events that shift balance of power.
- **Supernatural Elements**: Juju, rituals, and mystical influences that can affect gameplay.

### Blockchain Integration

The web3 application will integrate with AlstraNet's blockchain infrastructure, which includes:

- **Single-Token Economy**:
  - Alstra (ALSTRA): The native token of AlstraNet that serves as the unified currency for all game activities, governance, and transaction fees.

- **NFT Assets**:
  - Real estate properties across Lagos zones
  - Vehicles with performance attributes and modifications
  - Weapons and equipment with varying capabilities
  - Business operations and criminal enterprises

- **Smart Contract Framework**:
  - Territorial control through staking mechanics using Alstra tokens
  - Mission rewards and economic distribution
  - Governance voting and implementation
  - DeFi operations including lending, escrow, and liquidity provision

The web3 application will provide an interface to these blockchain elements, allowing players to manage their on-chain assets and activities through an intuitive, faction-appropriate interface.

### AlstraNet Integration

Detailed documentation of integration with AlstraNet blockchain features:

#### AlstraNet Blockchain

Police & Thief Web3 Application leverages AlstraNet's blockchain technology to deliver a seamless and efficient user experience:

- **Block Time**: The application takes advantage of AlstraNet's ~2 second block time to provide near-instant transaction confirmations for in-game actions and marketplace transactions.

- **Low Gas Fees**: AlstraNet's gas fees are 10-100x lower than Ethereum, enabling microtransactions for in-game purchases, small-value trades, and frequent state updates without prohibitive costs.

- **EVM Compatibility**: AlstraNet is 100% EVM compatible, allowing the application to use standard Solidity smart contracts and familiar development tools like Hardhat, Truffle, and Remix.

- **Hybrid Elastic Proof-of-Stake**: The application benefits from AlstraNet's consensus mechanism that balances security, performance, and economic sustainability.

#### Alstra Token Integration

The Alstra token serves as the unified currency for all application functions:

- **Transaction Fees**: All application transactions use Alstra for gas fees, with 50% of fees burned to control inflation.

- **Governance**: Alstra tokens provide voting power for DAO governance decisions, with delegation capabilities for players who prefer not to participate directly.

- **Staking**: Territory control is established through staking Alstra tokens, with rewards distributed based on AlstraNet's reward formula.

- **In-Game Economy**: All in-game purchases, marketplace transactions, and economic activities use Alstra as the currency.

#### Development Resources

Integration with AlstraNet is facilitated through these resources:

- **AlstraNet SDK**: The application uses the official AlstraNet SDK for core functionality like wallet connection, transaction handling, and contract interactions.

- **AlstraNet GameFi SDK**: Specialized tools for game developers to integrate blockchain features into games, with focus on NFTs, in-game economies, and player rewards.

- **AlstraNet React SDK**: React hooks and components that simplify integration of AlstraNet functionality into the web application.

- **Development Tools**: The application uses AlstraNet-compatible development tools including AlstraNet-specific Hardhat plugins and testing frameworks.
